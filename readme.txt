PROJECT DESCRIPTION
We did the suggested final project, taking project 02 and adding two features:
 (1) image meta-data extraction, and (2) search by meta-data.
During upload, we extract meta-data (date, location, etc.) and store this in the 
database. We also added a search function to the API to search a user’s folder for 
photos on/near a given date, and near a given location (latitude, longitude). We 
connected this to Google’s Geocoding API to convert street addresses to 
latitude/longitude for more human-friendly search (“near 2000 Sherman Avenue”).
